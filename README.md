This is project which creates randomly generated pop songs. The generation is done on a node server and then sent to a React frontend. 

I started the project with the philosophy that catchy music is reasonably formulaic and a good deal of songs are built with the same chords, tempos, keys, etc. The music theory behind the generation of the songs is fairly simple.
